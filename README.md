# Cascaded-Box-Conveyor-System-PLC-
In this project, a cascaded box conveyor system was designed and implemented using Mitsubishi’s GX Works software and a Mitsubishi PLC. The aim was to automate the sequential movement of boxes between multiple conveyor belts based on sensor input and logical conditions. 


I shared the PLC ladder diagram I created in GX Works under the file name “Ladder Diagram”. All input and output values are included in the “MX_Server_Tags” file. Additionally, the tags I created in GX Works are identical to the ones on the server, and I have shared those as well. To simulate the ladder diagram, I used Factory I/O, and the simulation setup is included in the file named “Conveyor System”.
